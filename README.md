Remember!
- Our SDKs are WeMos D1 Mini flashing compatible
- Set the BOARD to ESP32 DEV Module (or similar).
- You can also set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
- The SDK does NOT need external power to flash.  It will take Power from the USB 5V.
*You may though need to provide external DC for power up all the SDK functions.*
