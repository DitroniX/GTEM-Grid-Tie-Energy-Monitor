  GTEM-1 ATM90E26 Energy Monitoring Energy Monitor  v1.0
  Features include ESP32 GTEM ATM90E26 16bit ADC EEPROM OPTO CT-Clamp Current Voltage Frequency Power Factor GPIO I2C OLED SMPS D1 USB
  PCA 1.2212-105 - Test Code Firmware v1

  The purpose of this test code is to cycle through the various main functions of the board, as shown below, as part of board bring up testing.

  Simplified Board Bring Up Test -GTEM ATM90E26 Energy Monitor ASIC - Basic Calibration Limits.  Requires Calibration.
  Additional diagnostic serial reporting has been included, for reference and expanded detail.
  Three Modes:
    1 Calibration One upon Reset
     - User Button can be used to force single update the Display Registers.
    2 Domoticz Publish (Loop)

  Instructions.  See GitHub.com/DitroniX or DitroniX.net/Wiki for further information.

    - First Flash this code to a GTEM board and Run code.
    - Check the Mains Current and Voltage display on the Serial Monitor - Press board Reset to refresh data.
    - You should find that the values are pretty near what is expected i.e. voltage, current, power etc.
      - If not, update values, where needed, in the Excel 'Energy Setpoint Calculator GTEM Bring-Up Only.xlsx'.  Typically ONLY UGain or iGain.
      - Enter new/tweaked UGain (Voltage) and/or iGain (Current).
      - Update auto calculated Hex value(s) into 'GTEM-1_Defaults.h' > 'Calibration Defaults'.
      - Reflash code to board.
      - The Red LED will Flash upon a CRC1 or CRC2 error and then AUTOMATICALLY update the EEPROM and Reboot.
      - You should see a change in the values for Current, Voltage and resultant Power (Wattage).
      - Go back to XLS and update until you are happy that the values are near to your expected actual readings.
    - Update the Wifi, Domoticz Server and Device Index Values in 'Domoticz.h'.  Creating new Devices first in Domoticz.
    - Once you are happy with the values, update the 'EnableDomoticz' to 'true'.
    - Reflash code to board.  All done!

  Code register formulation based on the excellent ground work from Tisham Dhar, whatnick | ATM90E26 Energy Monitor | Code upgraded and updated by Date Williams

  Remember!
  Set the BOARD to ESP32, 'WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32' DEV Module (or similar).
  You may set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
  The SDK does NOT need external power to flash.  It will take Power from the USB 5V.

  Note: In the default state, upon first power up and during reset, the Green LED may be partially lit. Once programmed and the GPIO defined, the Green LED will go off after power up.

230510 - Minor changes
230218 - Averaging and Reduce Jitter, with Thresholds.  Added booleans 'DisableHardwareTest', also 'EnableBasicInfo' to simplifiy displayed values and loop this info
230125 - AT24C64 EEPROM Enabled.  Automatic CRC Update Upon Calibration Default Changes.  Various Small Code Updates
230121 - Various Small Code Updates.  Import/Export Power. Improvements to Domoticz.  Setup for 8V AC In.
230103 - Code Updates and Calibration Info
230103 - Updated to Platform IO and added support for Domoticz
221230 - Update to include I2C Scan, RGB LED and EEPROM Test.  Plus other tweaks on ATM Messages.
221223 - Update to SetPoint XLS. Values just generic for Board Bring-Up Testing.  Calibration is required.
221223 - Initial Code Released for PCA 1.2212-104.  This provides basic bring up of the GTEM-1 Board and ATM90E26 (SPI). Calibration is required, although this code will provide ability for board testing.


* Wish List | Future
To integrate both UART and SPI into one GTEM ATM Application, with software switch to select routines.
To Revamp SetPoint XLS to be more friendly.
