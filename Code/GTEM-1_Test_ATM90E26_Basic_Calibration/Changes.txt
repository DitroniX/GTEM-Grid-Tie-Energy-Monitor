  GTEM-1 ATM90E26 Energy Monitoring Energy Monitor  v1.0
  Features include ESP32 GTEM ATM90E26 16bit ADC EEPROM OPTO CT-Clamp Current Voltage Frequency Power Factor GPIO I2C OLED SMPS D1 USB
  PCA 1.2212-104 - Test Code Firmware v1 - 23th December 2022

  The purpose of this test code is to cycle through the various main functions of the board, as shown below, as part of board bring up testing.
  Simplified Board Bring Up Test -GTEM ATM90E26 Energy Monitor ASIC - Basic Calibration Limits.  Requires Calibration.
  Additional diagnostic serial reporting has been included, for reference and expanded detail.

  Code Based on the excellent work from Tisham Dhar, whatnick | ATM90E26 Energy Monitor | Updated Date Williams

  Remember!
  Set the BOARD to ESP32, 'WEMOS D1 MINI ESP32' DEV Module (or similar).
  You may set the BAUD rate to 921600 to speed up flashing.
  The SDK does NOT need external power to flash.  It will take Power from the USB 5V.

221223 - Initial Code Released for PCA 1.2212-104.  This provides basic bring up of the GTEM-1 Board and ATM90E26 (SPI). Calibration is required, although this code will provide ability for board testing.
221223 - Update to SetPoint XLS. Values just generic for Board Bring-Up Testing.  Calibration is required.




* Wish List | Future
To integrate both UART and SPI into one GTEM ATM Application, with software switch to select routines.
To Revamp SetPoint XLS to be more friendly.
